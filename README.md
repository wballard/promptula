# Overview
Here is a little gem that will give you a more informative shell prompt
as well as give you some ideas about how you can tweak your shell.

The prompt shows you a cool looking path, along with your current GiT
branch.

...and is even nice enough to show you when you have a dirty branch,
along with a nice little âœ³ for when there are untracked files that might
need to be added...
